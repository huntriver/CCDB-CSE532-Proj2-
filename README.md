In this project, you will be designing and implementing the Credit Card database using the objectrelational extensions of SQL â€” whatever is supported by PostgreSQL.  
You will be using Java/JSP/Servlets to build an application front end to your database. Database connectivity should be done using Java/JDBC. The most convenient way to work with servlets is to use Eclipse, NetBeans, or a similar IDE.
